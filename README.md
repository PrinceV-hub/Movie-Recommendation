# Movie Recommendation System Project

This repository contains a comprehensive movie recommendation system built using a hybrid approach that combines collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. The project analyzes movie data to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

### Key Features

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of the movies and ratings datasets, including genre distribution and movie popularity over time.
* **Collaborative Filtering:** Implementation and comparison of various machine learning algorithms, including SVD, KNNBasic, NMF, and others from the `Surprise` library, to find the best model for predicting user ratings.
* **Content-Based Filtering:** Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization on movie plot summaries to create a content profile for each movie. User profiles are then built based on the movies they have rated.
* **Hybrid Recommendation:** The system leverages both collaborative and content-based methods to generate personalized movie recommendations.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Compares the performance of different models using metrics like RMSE and MAE to determine the most effective approach.

### Technologies and Libraries

* **Python:** The primary programming language used.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn:** For text vectorization (TF-IDF).
* **Surprise:** A Python library for building and analyzing recommender systems.
* **Tqdm:** For progress bars to track long-running loops.

### Data and Methodology

The project uses two datasets: `movies.csv` and `ratings_small.csv`.

* `movies.csv` contains movie metadata, including titles, genres, descriptions, and more.
* `ratings_small.csv` contains user ratings for a subset of the movies.

The methodology is divided into two main parts:

#### 1. Collaborative Filtering
The `Surprise` library is used to build and evaluate several collaborative filtering models. The performance of SVD, KNNBasic, NMF, CoClustering, and SlopeOne are compared using 5-fold cross-validation to find the best-performing model based on RMSE and MAE. The SVD algorithm was found to be the top performer.

#### 2. Content-Based Filtering
This approach creates a profile for each movie based on its genres. User profiles are then generated by averaging the genre profiles of the movies they have rated. Finally, a TF-IDF matrix is created to calculate a predicted rating for unseen movies, and the top recommendations are generated.

The project code includes detailed sections for data exploration, model training, and recommendation generation.

### How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn surprise tqdm
    ```
3.  **Place Datasets:** Make sure `movies.csv` and `ratings_small.csv` are in the same directory as the Python script.
4.  **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script to perform the analysis and generate recommendations.

### Results and Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the characteristics of the data. The following visualizations show key insights:

* **Number of movies per genre:** The chart below shows the distribution of movies across various genres.

* **Movies over time:** A bar chart illustrating the number of movies released each year, showing trends in movie production.
* **Ratings Distribution:** The project analyzed the distribution of ratings, showing that most ratings fall between 3.5 and 5.0.
* **Most Active Users/Most Rated Movies:** The analysis identifies the users who have rated the most movies and the movies that have received the most ratings.
* **Model Comparison:** The RMSE values from the cross-validation of the collaborative filtering models were compared.


The results demonstrate that the collaborative filtering models, particularly SVD, outperform the basic content-based filtering approach for this dataset.

### Future Enhancements

* **Implement a Hybrid Model:** Combine the strengths of both collaborative and content-based filtering into a single, more robust recommendation model.
* **Deep Learning Models:** Explore more advanced models for text classification and recommendation, such as neural networks and embeddings.
* **API Integration:** Develop a simple user interface or API to allow users to get real-time movie recommendations.
